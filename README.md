Perform sales analysis to identify trends in pizza orders.
Analyze customer preferences based on pizza types and sizes.
Evaluate sales performance during different time frames (e.g., weekdays vs weekends).
Identify opportunities to improve sales strategies and inventory management.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
SQL: For data cleaning, extraction, and transformation.
Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
📊 Key Insights
